# Red-Bus-Selenium-Web-Scraping-

The "Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application" aims to revolutionize the transportation industry by providing a comprehensive solution for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing bus travel data. By utilizing Selenium for web scraping, this project automates the extraction of detailed information from Redbus, including bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability.

# Approach:
1.Data Scraping:
Use Selenium to automate the extraction of Redbus data including routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability.
2.Data Storage:
Store the scraped data in a SQL database.
3.Streamlit Application:
Develop a Streamlit application to display and filter the scraped data.
Implement various filters such as bustype, route, price range, star rating, availability.
4.Data Analysis/Filtering using Streamlit:
Use SQL queries to retrieve and filter data based on user inputs.
Use Streamlit to allow users to interact with and filter the data through the application.

# web app - streamlit:
With the help of Streamlit, created an interactive application similar to RedBus by designing a user-friendly interface that allows users to search for bus routes, view available buses, and get details like departure times, ratings and price details.
